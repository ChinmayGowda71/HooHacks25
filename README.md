# HooHacks25 -- Chrome SafeBrowse

## Contributors: Chinmay Gowda, Grant Lee, Vyas Narasimhan

SafeBrowse uses generative AI to identify and blur parts of any webpage based on how likely it is to affect someone based on their phobias, dislikes, and other factors. It works to filter out both sensitive text and images. It blurs every relevant part of the website before rendering it for the user, and provides options for the user to unblur certain parts of the website or add trusted websites to a whitelist.

To install, enter developer mode on your Chrome extensions page, press load unpacked, and select the folder labeled "frontend" in the github repo. It will load an extension named "Chrome SafeBrowse" into your extensions library.
